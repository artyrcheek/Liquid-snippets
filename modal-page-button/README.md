To use add `{% include 'modal' with "shipping" %}` where `shipping` is the name of a page you want the modal to be, the page title is the button text and the page content is the modal content
With this code i have used the [Spectre](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/) for button styling and the modal, but you can customize the code to work with your own classes and way of showing modals.
